    "\n",
    "You are working collaboratively with a team on a research project that includes developing code as well as writing a paper to communicate your results, and you need to ensure that all work is managed and tracked with git. Since you are learning about git in your class, your groupmates have asked you to propose a software development workflow for this project. Here, workflow is defined as the process by which the project is managed and developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your workflow must (at least) handle the following:\n",
    "1. What role (or roles) will each person have?\n",
    "2. How will changes be made/tracked?\n",
    "3. What are your requirements for commit messages?\n",
    "4. How do you expect people to work on their portions of the projects (using branches/merges)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, write down the guidelines for your proposed workflow, making sure to account for all of the items mentioned above.\n"

    "1. Each person on the project will be assigned specific tasks that need to be completed in relation to the development of the project, as well as another group member whose contributions they will be repsonsible for reviewing. This ensures that everyone is putting forth an equal amount of work as well as having the changes they make reviewed by another person to check for any bugs or errors that may arrise. Working on projects in the past, I've found that having another set of eyes on my code will often catch bugs that I was not able to forsee during development.\n",
    "2. Changes will be made and tracked through the git software and a public github repository. There will be a main repository that holds the project files, and three branches within the repository: main, developing, and testing. Code on the main branch should be fully tested and ensured that it is a helpful addition to the project. The main branch essentially is the current fully working version of the project. The developing branch is a space for group members to pull code we know is working from the main branch, and then add new features or revisions. Once the changes have been made, they should be commited for testing. That leaves the testing branch, where developers can pull new changes from the developing branch and write a number of tests to ensure that the new features are working entirely. The general idea is write code and commit to developing, pull that code, test it, and commit the tests to testing, if the tests pass and the code is good, add it to the main branch of the repository.\n",
    "3. Commit messages must be succint but as detailed as possible. Commit messages should not be paragraphs of text, they should, ideally, be one (two, absoulte maximum) sentence(s) describing the purpose of the commit, and what is being commited. This will allow other developers to have a good idea of what group members are contributing, without having to view the entire commit.\n",
    "4. I kind of mentioned this above, but the three branch workflow idea seems solid. There is room for other branches as well, wherever the need may arrise. One example could be a branch for presentation/paper files, used for commiting text files that present and review the project for communication purposes. However, this issue may be solved in an easier fashion by just commiting these files to a specific folder in the repository. But again, the general idea is develop -> test -> merge to the main branch. Keeping branches separate allows for effective development and will prevent bad code from being added to the main project, as well as developers making changes that will clash with other features currently being created."

    "**Debugging code is the process of reviewing the software you write to solve any errors that arrise. There are two major types of errors in programming, errors with how the code is behaving, and errors with how you have written the code. If you don't follow the syntax rules of the language you are writing in, this wil cause your code to fail, and you must debug. This can come from misusing a function and its parameters, incorrect keywords, or using reserved variable names (SyntaxError), etc, but it can also be from accessing memory outside of the allocated location (IndexError) or using the wrong object type (TypeError), among many other scenarios. Similarly, if your code runs and is syntactically sound, but it isn't producing the output you expected, you have to go through and figure out what is causing the unexpected behavior. In both of these situations, there are a number of techniques you can deploy to figure out what is going wrong. The first, and arguably the most useful, is using a search engine. Chances are, someone out in the world has run into the same (or a very similar) issue as you, and they have asked for help online. Googling your error type can often lead you to a solution on how to fix it. If that doesn't work, however, another handy tool is printing to the console. Almost every programming language has a built in function to print text and other values to the console. Adding print statements throughout your code will allow you to see what values are being passed around throughout the lifespan of the application. This can often lead to figuring out what is breaking the code, or why it isn't behaving as intended. Lastly, more experienced developers can make use of text editors with a built in debugging software. Debuggers are an incredibly useful tool that can step through your code line by line, stop at specified points, and highlights what values are currently being stored and used by the program. This is my favorite method to use, and it has saved me a lot of time and headache in the past when working on projects.**"

The first thing I ran into is an error in the math equation, the 0.5 was not being added in the parentheses of either equation. Next, I noticed that the plotting lines for the cos data and the legend were included after plt.show(). This was causing the data to be plotted on separate figures, and the legend to not show up. Again, the process worked well. Both of the errors that needed debugging in the past two problems seemed simple enough to just go over the code without needing print statements or Google.**"
