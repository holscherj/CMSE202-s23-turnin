    "*While there was some variance in the results between the different iterations, the differences in precision, recall, and accuracy are not very significant. Looking at precision and recall, it seemed that these values changed the most from random_state to random_state. Starting initially at ~0.777 and ~0.551 respectively, the precision jumped as high as ~0.817 for random_state = 125 and as low as ~0.717 for random_state = 126. Recall reached a low of ~0.437 at random_state = 128, and a high of ~0.572 at random_state = 125. Accuracy seemed to vary much less than the other two values. Initially coming in at around ~0.864, the highest value it hit, and it dipped down only to ~0.849 at its lowest. This doesn't really change my answer to 5.1. As you can see, the accuracy of the model still outperforms the baseline, in all cases, and I still think they would perform better if refined slightly. It's possible the lower recall values could pose an issue in some cases, but for this, I still think the high precision and accuracy make these models useful for predicting rain.*"
